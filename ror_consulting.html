<p>
Typically clients reach me in following cases:
<ul>
  <li>Rails app is slow or can't handle the growth of the userbase.</li>
  <li>They need to <a href="https://vertalab.com/build-an-mvp-in-one-and-a-half-days-mission-impossible/">build an MVP</a> fast.</li>
  <li>It becomes a pain to introduce changes and developers hate to work on their app.</li>
  <li>They need a technical guidance to build an architecture and roadmap for their new product.</li>
  <li>They need a help in building development team. This includes tech interviews and setting up development processes. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I started working with Rails in 2007 since then I helped a dozen of clients to solve their technical challenges. I founded or played a lead role in few startups. Most of them failed but this gave me experience and strong understanding how technology can solve people's problems.

<p>
In 2013 I founded Vertalab, a software development company focused in Ruby.
My main responsibility there is hiring, managing, and mentoring software developers. I am passionate about building an atmosphere that would allow employees realize their full potential.

<p>
Along with Ruby-related technologies, I have a good understanding of Machine Learning, Javascript, Go. I am a fun of model thinking and simplicity. This allows me to solve a wide range of technical challenges and help business to grow.
